Code for signature verification can be found in this repository. Tensorflow is used, and the following are the folder details: Verify signatures. model is stored in the ipynb file Real Images contain dataset for this project in the form of real training folder will save the trained images Forged Images contain dataset for this project in the form of real (this folder will create when you will execute the code) The format in which images are saved is: XXXZZZ YYY The id of the person who signed the document is represented by the letter XXX (ex -001) The id of the person to whom the sign actually belongs is shown by the letters ZZZ (ex- 001) Then'th attempt is denoted by YYY.
